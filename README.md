An API created to help people make healthier nutrition decisions

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to create a technological means to contribute to healtheir eating habits. There are many platforms available that try to reinvent the wheel of making healthy decisions about the food you eat. The principles of success are the simple; find a balance between caloric intake and energy use to achieve your weight goals, eat quality foods where you can, and most importantly try to maintain your mental health at the same time. Often, the tools and convictions of the platform owners make it hard for users to succeed. Diets also have a tendency to consume us, creating unhealthy relationships with food and exercise. My hope is to create an API that can be the foundation that allows others to build platforms that are unique to their coaching styles, but felxible enough so that platform users have the tools necessary to succeed.

# About the Maintainer
My name is Stephen (Steve) Morgan. I'm a technology professional with 15+ years supporting production software environments. Most of my experience relates to infrastructure, monitoring, and deployments, but I'm currently working to take that experience and apply it to a Software Engineering role. This project will demonstrate my capabilities around creating and maintaining software and, as well I hope it will provide a starting point for others to build upon.
